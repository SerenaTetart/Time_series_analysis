## General info
In this repository we will be learning how to analyse a time serie and forecast it's values.

## Requirements

The basic libraries for machine learning and deep learning ðŸ˜ƒ

Libraries:

## Project 1 - Bitcoin Forecast with LSTM

The dataset used is the market price everyday since 2014, I shared it in the repository.

A time serie is composed of 4 components:
* <b>Level:</b> the baseline value for the series
* <b>Trend:</b> Linear increasing or decreasing behavior of the serie over time
* <b>Seasonality:</b> Repeating patterns or cycles of behavior over time.
* <b>Noise:</b> Variability in the observations that cannot be explained by the model

The reunion of these 4 components is equal to the time serie, it can be additive if:

<p align="center"> <b>y = level + trend + seasonality + noise</b> </p>

or multiplicative if:

<p align="center"> <b>y = level * trend * seasonality * noise</b> </p>

In our case the time serie is multiplicative.

We can clearly see that the trend is constantly rising, with a peak toward 2021.

The trend is a centered moving average, first we remove the mean by dividing each individual value by the series mean:

</p>

Then we calculate the moving average based on a sliding window *L* :

The seasonality indicates that there is an even more rising trend toward january and june.

(I'll finish to write this tomorrow...)

The network is made of two layers of bidirectionnal LSTM units with a 20 dense at the end, why 20 ? Because it predicts the next 20 values of the time serie, it could have been less or more...
This change has been made in order to have a more accurate prediction, whereas if it predicts only the next value it can easily overfit.

(I'll finish to write this tomorrow...)

## Project 2 - ARIMA

In this second project we will try to get useful statistics from the data by turning it into a stationary serie.

A stationary serie is a serie that does not depend on time (just like the stationary SchrÃ¶dinger Equation or TISE where the wave function can be expressed only with the spatial part)

## Project 3 - Anomaly Detection

This third project aims to detect in a given time serie the anomalies using statisticals models and autoencoder.
