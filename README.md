## Project 1 - Bitcoin forecasting with LSTM

The dataset used is the market price everyday since 2014, here we will be using the closing price, I shared it in the repository.

A time serie is composed of 3 components:
* (<b>y:</b> the baseline value for the series)
* <b>Trend:</b> Linear increasing or decreasing behavior of the serie over time
* <b>Seasonality:</b> Repeating patterns or cycles of behavior over time.
* <b>Noise:</b> Variability in the observations that cannot be explained by the model

The reunion of these 3 components is equal to the time serie, it can be additive if:

<p align="center"> <b>y = trend + seasonality + noise</b> </p>

or multiplicative if:

<p align="center"> <b>y = trend * seasonality * noise</b> </p>

In our case the time serie is multiplicative.

We can clearly see that the trend is constantly rising, with a peak toward 2021.

The Trend is calculated based on the moving average with a sliding window *L* :

The seasonality indicates that there is a rising trend toward January and June and a decreasing trend in between.

In order to get the seasonality and the noise we need to refer to the multiplicative formula in the beginning:

</p>

Then in order to isolate the seasonality we calculate the moving average based on one year, **L=365** (could be one month) of our last formula:

</p>

Finally we calculate the noise by dividing the seasonal noise by the seasonal component:

</p>

The network is made of two layers of bidirectionnal LSTM units with a 20 dense at the end in order to predict the next 20 values of the time serie.

LSTMs are great at learning from long-term dependencies on sequences of data, when made bidirectionnal they also train on a reversed copy of the input sequence, this can provide additional context to the network and result in faster and even fuller learning on the problem.

Sadly the forecasts are quite imprecise, this is because there is a lot of noises and actions or cryptocurrencies price depends on a lot of factors that a time serie alone can not represent.

</p>

Though the model did manage to learn a rising trend and is not totally wrong.

But for this last forecast I don't think it's right.

## Project 2 - Bitcoin forecasting with multivariate time series

This second project aims to forecast the price of Bitcoin using the closing price and the closing price of other time series as well (such as Ethereum price).

But nope this is still too bad.
